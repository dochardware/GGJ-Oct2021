## Outline
The company is having a company wide presentation that both girls are preparing for like Apple

When you walk in downstairs there are people blocking entry to the next room. Chris comments on this and you get into the elevator for the title card. You have your meet scene(s) both girls. Then when you go to talk to clementine she tells you the printer is broken and she needs a spare from downstairs 

The minigame has you avoiding people in the crowd to get to the supply room. The better you do, the more impressed she is. Do poorly and she still says thanks but that locks the dating route for her for now.
